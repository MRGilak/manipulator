# manipulator
This is a repo for the object-oriented MATLAB codes for simulaing any manipuator, including all the kinematics and dynamics. Several control techniques will later be added to control the robot, including Proportional Derivative (PD) and Slotine controllers.

## Kinematics
The kinematics are solved using the Denavit-Hartenberg technique, hereby after referred to as DH. The frames are shown in the image below.
